# MMDVM-Nextion-Screen-Layouts  
  
Here you will find a collection of screen layouts I have put together for Nextion Screens.  
Both Duplex and Simplex Hot Spot layouts are available.  
In the main github page for this repository you will find a file called "Instructions.md".   
The "instructions.md" file has instructions on how to do basic text box editing to Nextion HMI files as well as how to get the HMI files compiled and sent to the Nextion screen, (basically all you need to know to get your screen going).  

I am testing these layout files with the Nextion 2.4" and 3.2" displays.  
If anyone would like to provide feedback please contact me at wa6hxg@gmail.com

File explanation...   
  
The HMI Files directory include HMI files for the Nextion Editor, they may be edited and Compiled to TFT Files. (instructions   for that process are here on my Github page in the Instructions.md file).  
The TFT Files directory include TFT files for direct upload to the Nextion screen. (instructions for that process are in the   Instructions.md file). Files with the suffix GB have green signal bars around the antenna icon instead of white.
