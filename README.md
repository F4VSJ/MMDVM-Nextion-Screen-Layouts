# MMDVM-Nextion-Screen-Layouts
Here is a collection of screen layouts I have put together for Nextion Screens
I am testing them with the Nextion Enhanced (NX40244K032_11) 3.2" Screen
I believe they also work for the Non_Enhanced screens. (Confirmation welcome)
If anyone would like to provide feedback please contact me at wa6hxg@gmail.com
I will be working on 2.4" screens next...Feedback is appreciated.
